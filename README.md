---------------------------------------------

For the next TP you will need a working Docker, please install it:
  - You have to do this before the next lab as it is long for the first launch to download the docker image
  - You can work with Docker on Windows only if you have a professional version on Windows 10
  - If not you will need a Linux or MacOS to work with docker
  
  - To make sure that it works:
    - on Linux/macOS run the file run.sh from the folder Test_Docker_next_lab in your terminal with the command ./run.sh
    - on Windows run the file run.bat from the folder Test_Docker_next_lab
    - Docker will start downloading the docker image https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/all-spark-notebook (it can take a while)
    - Then you will see some urls in your terminal try to open the last one in your browser, if you see the UI of Jupyter then everything works and will be ready for the next TP.
